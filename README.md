# CALCULATOR-AND-SMITHCHART-PLOT-FOR-INPUT-IMPEDANCE
due to difficult reason to calculate input impedance either with mathematics calculations using Zin formulas  (lossy or lossless) or  using Smithchart, this code help to calculate the input impedance easily. user just have to input all the needed parameters then the value and smithchartplot displayed
